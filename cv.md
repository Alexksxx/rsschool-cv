## About me
Not so long ago I solve to change my life. Actually, I think about this for a couple of years, but I didn't want to lose my former life. I think about IT sphere, but I didn't know how direction is better. My friend showed me how he makes website pages. And I understood: I want to create. 
I started learning two months ago. All this time I was studying by video on YouTube and articles. Step by step, I improved my knowledge and skills. Than I know exactly I want to be a front-end developer. I really like to create something new, especially an interactive. And fortunately, I like to study. Besides, I'm actively learning English for a half year. 
I believe, this course will help me to become a good specialist and find new friends.
